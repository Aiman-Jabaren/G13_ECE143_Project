Problem:
Analysis of Diabetic Data to find different trends and correlation

Summary:

Methodology:

Dataset:
Statistics from World Health Organization (WHO), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US Department of Health & Human Services, UCI machine learning repository

Real-world Application and Proposed Solution:
Heart Diseases are the number 1 killer in the United States, More than 610,000 people die of heart diseases every year, that is 1 in every 4 deaths. Diabetes which is a disease itself, is also one of the main causes of heart diseases. It’s of a great interest to investigate the factors and risks of Diabetes and analyze them in order to be able to combat it and stop it from spreading.
Diabetes is spreading at a very high rate in developed and developing countries. Although it has been researched for so long, it’s still one of the most complex diseases, since its risks are embedded in modern cultures and they are nature and nurture risks. Diabetes has correlation with age, gender, income, family history and diet.
There is an endless supply of data available for a variety of life-threatening diseases, but often this data is fragmented and does not tell the whole story of the numerous causes of the disease, or its prevalence in populations varying in geographical area, income, age, access to healthcare, etc. 
Accurate graphs of disease prevalence and spreading will allow health organizations and individuals to protect and heal those affected. For example, knowing areas where diabetes has become more common will allow groups such as the WHO to predict the best locations for health services and coordinate with local populations.
We propose developing a program that takes in publically-available data for diabetes, link it to other heart diseases such as myocardial infarction and plots diabetes’ prevalence vs different factors such as age, gender, education level, diet, income, and smoking status. We will also plot diabetes prevalence according to the country of origin in order to visualize the disease distribution. We also intend to plot the disease prevalence in different time frames through a heatmap.  
We choose these plots because we believe they will provide the most effective tools for finding commonality between the diseases. Although our solution can be extended to virtually 
any disease or socioeconomic disparity, we choose diabetes and heart disease because of how common and debilitating they are. Our hope is that our project will provide an effective framework for future work on the consolidation of disease data and research.
