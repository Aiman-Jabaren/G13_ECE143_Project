## Problem:
        Analysis of Diabetic Data to find different trends and correlation

## Summary:

## Methodology:
- After a diabetes overview research, we summarized the main points of interests for investigating diabetes.
- Different datasets and statistics were scrapped from national and international health organization, such as: World Health   Organization and CDC
- We filtered the datasets according to credibility and interest
- We summarized the possible datasets/ plots we need in order to answer the questions
- We have mainly used public Python libraries in order to process the data. 
- Some of the processing we have implemnted was: calculating averages of diabetics and overweight population in different countries, calculated correclation between diabetes possible risk factors, normalized risk factors per country and per county, plotted diabetes prevalence according to age and years and subdivided population into subgroups of diabetes treatment and awareness.
- We have used Python libraries and platfroms such as Geopandas, Bokeh, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and HoloViews in order to visualize and infer from the processed data
